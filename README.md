Aeroponics is a soil- and water-free method of growing plants, where roots are misted with a nutrient-rich solution. This technique is particularly beneficial for potato cultivation, especially for producing disease-free seed potatoes in controlled environments, leading to higher yields and reduced pesticide use. This paper presents the design of a monitoring and control system for an aeroponic potato growing chamber. The system uses sensors to track temperature and humidity, displaying data on an LCD and sending it to a computer for remote monitoring. A microcontroller-based control system adjusts actuators, including pumps, mist makers, and fans, to regulate water and nutrient delivery. The system was tested in a greenhouse, where it maintained optimal conditions for potato growth, with an average temperature of 19.6Â°C and 83.3% relative humidity, which are ideal for potatoes. The pH of the nutrient solution was kept at 5.8, ensuring efficient nutrient absorption. The results showed that the system effectively controlled environmental factors, improved potato plant health, and reduced operational costs. This aeroponic method offers a sustainable, cost-effective alternative for potato seed production, with potential for higher yields and lower agricultural inputs. Further research is needed to refine nutrient balance and assess the system's economic viability.
