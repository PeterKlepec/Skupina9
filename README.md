Naj en uzame(): Monitoring and control of aeroponic growing system for potato production

Aeroponics is a soil- and water-free method of growing plants, where roots are misted with a nutrient-rich solution. This technique is particularly beneficial for potato cultivation, especially for producing disease-free seed potatoes in controlled environments, leading to higher yields and reduced pesticide use. This paper presents the design of a monitoring and control system for an aeroponic potato growing chamber. The system uses sensors to track temperature and humidity, displaying data on an LCD and sending it to a computer for remote monitoring. A microcontroller-based control system adjusts actuators, including pumps, mist makers, and fans, to regulate water and nutrient delivery. The system was tested in a greenhouse, where it maintained optimal conditions for potato growth, with an average temperature of 19.6°C and 83.3% relative humidity, which are ideal for potatoes. The pH of the nutrient solution was kept at 5.8, ensuring efficient nutrient absorption. The results showed that the system effectively controlled environmental factors, improved potato plant health, and reduced operational costs. This aeroponic method offers a sustainable, cost-effective alternative for potato seed production, with potential for higher yields and lower agricultural inputs. Further research is needed to refine nutrient balance and assess the system's economic viability.

Aeroponics is a method of growing plants without soil or water, using a nutrient-rich mist sprayed directly on the roots. This technique is particularly beneficial for potato cultivation, enabling disease-free seed production in controlled environments, which can improve yields and reduce pesticide use. This paper describes the design and implementation of a monitoring and control system for an aeroponic potato growing chamber. The system uses sensors to monitor temperature and humidity, displaying the data on an LCD and sending it to a computer for remote monitoring. A microcontroller-driven control system regulates actuators (such as pumps, mist makers, and fans) to deliver water and nutrients at optimal times and amounts. Tested in a greenhouse, the system successfully maintained ideal growing conditions with an average temperature of 19.6°C and 83.3% humidity. The nutrient solution's pH was maintained at 5.8 for efficient nutrient absorption. Results showed that the system effectively controlled environmental factors, improved plant health, and increased yields. This aeroponic method offers a sustainable and cost-effective solution for potato seed production, with the potential to reduce agricultural costs and environmental impact. Further studies are needed to optimize nutrient balance and assess the system’s economic feasibility.
