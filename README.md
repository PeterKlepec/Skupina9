**1. Spatial Analysis for Crop Land Suitability Evaluation: A Case Study of Potatoes Cultivation in Wonosobo, Indonesia**

At present, the potatoes cultivation strategy is still based on farmers preferences. They plant on their land without seeing the crop land suitability. This causes a low productivity of 16.99 tons/ha and the production target is not achieved, only 85.93%. The objectives of this study was to provide recommendations for optimizing suitable crop land using spatial analysis with overlay techniques. The contribution of this study was the combination of 5 physical factors in spatial analysis with overlay techniques to evaluate the crop land suitability value. We refer to Regulation Agriculture Minister of Republic of Indonesia No. 07/Permentan/OT.140/2/2012 with development based on overlay maps land ability, land suitability, regional potential and land for sustainable food agriculture. To measure the location suitability, we used five physical controls in spatial analysis of crop land suitability, namely altitude, soil texture, slope percentage, rainfall and temperature. We obtained 16 grids on all crop land units and we determined the samples were 16 points in Wonosobo, Indonesia. We used intervals of 3.75 and 4 classes to analyzed crop land suitability. By using overlay techniques, the results showed that the average has suitability for the crop land in good condition, with a few inhibiting factors that is equal to 67.21% spread in samples 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14. To support sustainable food agriculture, we recommend cropping focus in Kejajar (sample number 1) which has the most suitable land suitability value for potato cultivation in Wonosobo. For further research, this method can be used to calculate the Land Potential Index using spatial analysis and remote sensing.

**2. Low Cost IoT Based Smart Irrigation System for Potato Cultivation**

In today's world Smart agriculture is playing vital role to enhance quality and quantity of food production with optimum utilization of farmers' time and efforts. Smart irrigation is an important component of it. Potato cultivation needs regular irrigation for maintaining the required soil moisture. Potato plants are normally grown in dry season. Therefore, scarcity of water for irrigation is observed in many potato fields. Here we have proposed a smart irrigation system for optimum usage of water during irrigation in potato fields. Prior to performing smart irrigation, various soil parameters were monitored, like soil type, humidity, and temperature of the atmosphere. To ensure the quality of water that is to be supplied to the potato plants, the water pH was also checked. Data from the sensors were transferred to the edge server using Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology and from the edge server to the cloud using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. Machine learning classification models and Deep belief neural network (DBNN) are employed to create intelligent irrigation systems, and a quick comparative analysis has been done with earlier studies. The results obtained helped us to conclude that our system achieved optimum use of water for irrigation.

**3. On the Selection of Features for the Prediction Model of Cultivation of Sweet Potatoes at Early Growth Stage**

With the changes in the agricultural environment, the cultivation of sweet potatoes today cannot be managed extensively as in the early days. The increase in production costs makes it necessary for enterprises that manage agricultural lands to estimate the premium grade yield more accurately, reduce the risk and cost of supply shortages, and even further improve premium grade yield and maximize the value of agricultural properties. In the past, the forecast of premium grade yield used manual inspection and field sampling to judge the growth status of sweet potato and infer the final output of premium-grade sweet potatoes, but such an estimation method requires long-term tracking and could not do early supply planning. Therefore, this study aims to develop a prediction model for sweet potato production, using cultivation information provided by a sweet potato depot manufacturer in Taiwan, agro-meteorological information provided by an agricultural improvement farm in Taiwan, and the wholesale price of sweet potato provided by Taiwan Council of Agriculture. Combining the information from the planting day to 4 days after planting, we determine the features of the model that predicts excellent potato yield during the early planting stage of sweet potatoes. We investigate hierarchical feature clustering and simulated annealing feature selection, removing features that are unrelated to yield prediction, and redundant features that are highly correlated with other features. Our results show that the 3-day-after-planting information may provide predictable information in the feature selection stage, and the wholesale price of sweet potato was found to be related to the premium-grade yield in the experiment.

**5. Study of the effect of electromagnetic radiation of extremely high frequency wavelength on potato growth rate**

The experimental investigations of the impact of low-intensity electromagnetic fields of extremely high frequency on morphometric growth parameters of potato tubers seedlings, as well as growth parameters of plants and potato tubers are carried out in the “Scientific Research Institute of Applied Electrodynamics, Photonics and Living Systems ” (SRI AEPLS). This article presents the results of investigations, tubers processing methods and estimation of the used EMF parameters. Possible approaches are discussed to the mathematical modeling of treatment of dielectric materials, to which the potato sprouts and tubers should be attributed. The procedure of these investigations was as follows: specified groups of samples of potato tubers, before vemalization in light and subsequent germination or planting in the ground, were treated with EMF of EHF with a wavelength of 7.1 mm, low intensity - no more than 1mW/sm 2 . The duration of this treatment and, as a result, the EMF energy absorbed by tubers had different values for different groups of samples.

**1. Monitoring and control of aeroponic growing system for potato production**

In Indonesia, the Vegetable Research Institute (Balitsa) has been collaborating with the International Potato Center (CIP) to advance potato research, particularly in developing new potato varieties. Indonesia has hosted the CIP's regional office for East, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific since 1992. One challenge in potato cultivation is improving the quality of potato seeds, which is crucial for increasing production. Recently, the aeroponic system, a technique adapted from NASA’s research, has gained attention as an efficient, hygienic, and cost-effective method for potato seed production. Unlike traditional soil-based systems, which yield about 8 bulbs per plant, aeroponics can produce up to 70 bulbs per plant. This method not only boosts seed production but also reduces costs and enhances the health of the seeds for field cultivation.
To optimize this system, greenhouse operations in Lembang face challenges in monitoring and controlling variables such as temperature, humidity, light, and air quality. Sensors can help monitor these factors, while actuators manage nutrient and water delivery to the plants. Aeroponic systems have shown a tenfold increase in production compared to other methods and are particularly effective in producing generation zero (GO) potato seeds. Integrating sensors and actuators can further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of potato cultivation in controlled environments.

**2. Disease Identification in Potato Leaves using Swin Transformer**

Agriculture is vital for food security, and in Indonesia, potatoes are an essential staple crop alongside rice and corn. For potato farmers, maintaining plant health is crucial, and diseases like early blight and late blight, which affect potato leaves, can cause significant losses if not detected early. Early recognition allows for timely prevention, but human limitations in diagnosing these diseases can be addressed with computer vision techniques powered by deep learning.
Deep learning, a branch of Artificial Intelligence, is widely used in image recognition and object detection tasks. Common models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT) have been successful in computer vision applications. More recent innovations, such as the Swin Transformer, offer more efficient and effective solutions.
This paper explores the use of the Swin Transformer to classify potato leaf diseases, aiming to improve early detection and prevention for farmers. The research modifies the model's parameters to enhance accuracy compared to other computer vision models. Additionally, the study highlights how the Swin Transformer’s Shifted Windows approach is particularly suitable for processing images of potato leaf diseases, offering a promising solution for enhancing disease management in potato farming.

**3. Activation Function Comparison On Potato Leaf Disease Classification Performance**

Potatoes are a vital crop in Indonesia, ranking second after rice, with significant contributions to both household consumption and industries such as flour and chip production. In 2021, Indonesia produced 1.36 million tons of potatoes, with East Java, West Java, and Central Java being major contributors. However, potato cultivation faces challenges from pests and diseases, especially early blight and late blight, which affect the leaves.
Traditionally, disease detection relies on subjective methods like visual inspection, which are time-consuming and less accurate. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offer more efficient and precise disease diagnosis. CNNs, commonly used in medical image recognition, are well-suited for classifying potato leaf diseases, distinguishing between healthy leaves, early blight, and late blight.
To improve model accuracy, the research utilizes data preprocessing techniques, such as oversampling to address class imbalances, and data augmentation methods like rescaling, rotation, flipping, and zooming. The CNN method is tested with varying epochs (50, 150, 200, 250, and 300) and activation functions (ReLU and tanh). This AI-driven approach aims to enhance disease management in potato farming, enabling faster and more accurate diagnosis, leading to better crop yields and improved agricultural productivity.

**4. Potato Crop Disease Prediction using Deep Learning**

Potatoes are a vital global food crop, providing essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, and vitamins. They are important in both developed and developing countries, with their quality directly influencing market prices. However, manual quality control, which is still commonly used, is costly and subjective. To address this, computer vision and machine learning techniques have been developed to automate and improve the efficiency of quality control in agriculture.
Potatoes' nutritional composition varies depending on factors like growth conditions and soil type, with water content typically ranging from 70-80% and starch content from 16-24%. Despite their nutritional value, potato production faces significant challenges from diseases like early and late blight, caused by pathogens such as *Phytophthora infestans* and *Alternaria solani*. These diseases have led to reduced production and environmental issues due to excessive pesticide use.
Recent research has applied deep learning and image processing techniques to detect potato leaf diseases. The process involves image segmentation, feature extraction, and classification into categories like healthy, early blight, and late blight. Data from various sources is used to train and test models, with about 80% of images used for training. The proposed method helps farmers predict and manage disease outbreaks, reducing reliance on pesticides and improving crop management.

**5. CNN based Disease Detection Approach on Potato Leaves**
Potatoes are a significant crop in Bangladesh, making the country the 7th largest producer worldwide. Around 5 lakh hectares of land are used annually for potato cultivation, yielding between 0.7 crore to 1.09 crore tons. Potatoes are crucial to the nation's agricultural economy. However, potato production is threatened by various diseases like early blight, late blight, brown spot, bacterial wilt, and septoria blight, which have led to decreased yields and export levels. Early blight shows as small black lesions, while late blight appears as blistered, scalded spots, and septoria blight manifests as grey spots with dark margins. These diseases significantly impact both the quality and quantity of potatoes.
To address this issue, the proposed solution involves using deep learning models for the classification of potato leaves into healthy and diseased categories. By training on a dataset of images labeled as healthy, early blight, and late blight, the model can detect diseases early and help farmers take timely action to manage crop health. This model will utilize approximately 70% of the images for training and 30% for testing. By automating disease identification, the model will support improved potato production and exports, ultimately benefiting farmers and the country's agricultural economy.

**1. Early stage Potato Disease Classification by analyzing Potato Plants using CNN**
   
Aeroponics is a method of growing plants without soil or water, using a nutrient-rich mist sprayed directly on the roots. This technique is particularly beneficial for potato cultivation, enabling disease-free seed production in controlled environments, which can improve yields and reduce pesticide use. This paper describes the design and implementation of a monitoring and control system for an aeroponic potato growing chamber. The system uses sensors to monitor temperature and humidity, displaying the data on an LCD and sending it to a computer for remote monitoring. A microcontroller-driven control system regulates actuators (such as pumps, mist makers, and fans) to deliver water and nutrients at optimal times and amounts. Tested in a greenhouse, the system successfully maintained ideal growing conditions with an average temperature of 19.6°C and 83.3% humidity. The nutrient solution's pH was maintained at 5.8 for efficient nutrient absorption. Results showed that the system effectively controlled environmental factors, improved plant health, and increased yields. This aeroponic method offers a sustainable and cost-effective solution for potato seed production, with the potential to reduce agricultural costs and environmental impact. Further studies are needed to optimize nutrient balance and assess the system’s economic feasibility.
