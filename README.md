**1. Monitoring and control of aeroponic growing system for potato production**

In Indonesia, the Vegetable Research Institute (Balitsa) has been collaborating with the International Potato Center (CIP) to advance potato research, particularly in developing new potato varieties. Indonesia has hosted the CIP's regional office for East, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific since 1992. One challenge in potato cultivation is improving the quality of potato seeds, which is crucial for increasing production. Recently, the aeroponic system, a technique adapted from NASA’s research, has gained attention as an efficient, hygienic, and cost-effective method for potato seed production. Unlike traditional soil-based systems, which yield about 8 bulbs per plant, aeroponics can produce up to 70 bulbs per plant. This method not only boosts seed production but also reduces costs and enhances the health of the seeds for field cultivation.
To optimize this system, greenhouse operations in Lembang face challenges in monitoring and controlling variables such as temperature, humidity, light, and air quality. Sensors can help monitor these factors, while actuators manage nutrient and water delivery to the plants. Aeroponic systems have shown a tenfold increase in production compared to other methods and are particularly effective in producing generation zero (GO) potato seeds. Integrating sensors and actuators can further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of potato cultivation in controlled environments.

**2. Disease Identification in Potato Leaves using Swin Transformer**

Agriculture is vital for food security, and in Indonesia, potatoes are an essential staple crop alongside rice and corn. For potato farmers, maintaining plant health is crucial, and diseases like early blight and late blight, which affect potato leaves, can cause significant losses if not detected early. Early recognition allows for timely prevention, but human limitations in diagnosing these diseases can be addressed with computer vision techniques powered by deep learning.
Deep learning, a branch of Artificial Intelligence, is widely used in image recognition and object detection tasks. Common models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT) have been successful in computer vision applications. More recent innovations, such as the Swin Transformer, offer more efficient and effective solutions.
This paper explores the use of the Swin Transformer to classify potato leaf diseases, aiming to improve early detection and prevention for farmers. The research modifies the model's parameters to enhance accuracy compared to other computer vision models. Additionally, the study highlights how the Swin Transformer’s Shifted Windows approach is particularly suitable for processing images of potato leaf diseases, offering a promising solution for enhancing disease management in potato farming.

**3. Activation Function Comparison On Potato Leaf Disease Classification Performance**

Potatoes are a vital crop in Indonesia, ranking second after rice, with significant contributions to both household consumption and industries such as flour and chip production. In 2021, Indonesia produced 1.36 million tons of potatoes, with East Java, West Java, and Central Java being major contributors. However, potato cultivation faces challenges from pests and diseases, especially early blight and late blight, which affect the leaves.
Traditionally, disease detection relies on subjective methods like visual inspection, which are time-consuming and less accurate. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offer more efficient and precise disease diagnosis. CNNs, commonly used in medical image recognition, are well-suited for classifying potato leaf diseases, distinguishing between healthy leaves, early blight, and late blight.
To improve model accuracy, the research utilizes data preprocessing techniques, such as oversampling to address class imbalances, and data augmentation methods like rescaling, rotation, flipping, and zooming. The CNN method is tested with varying epochs (50, 150, 200, 250, and 300) and activation functions (ReLU and tanh). This AI-driven approach aims to enhance disease management in potato farming, enabling faster and more accurate diagnosis, leading to better crop yields and improved agricultural productivity.

**4. Potato Crop Disease Prediction using Deep Learning**

Potatoes are a vital global food crop, providing essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, and vitamins. They are important in both developed and developing countries, with their quality directly influencing market prices. However, manual quality control, which is still commonly used, is costly and subjective. To address this, computer vision and machine learning techniques have been developed to automate and improve the efficiency of quality control in agriculture.
Potatoes' nutritional composition varies depending on factors like growth conditions and soil type, with water content typically ranging from 70-80% and starch content from 16-24%. Despite their nutritional value, potato production faces significant challenges from diseases like early and late blight, caused by pathogens such as *Phytophthora infestans* and *Alternaria solani*. These diseases have led to reduced production and environmental issues due to excessive pesticide use.
Recent research has applied deep learning and image processing techniques to detect potato leaf diseases. The process involves image segmentation, feature extraction, and classification into categories like healthy, early blight, and late blight. Data from various sources is used to train and test models, with about 80% of images used for training. The proposed method helps farmers predict and manage disease outbreaks, reducing reliance on pesticides and improving crop management.

**5. CNN based Disease Detection Approach on Potato Leaves**
Potatoes are a significant crop in Bangladesh, making the country the 7th largest producer worldwide. Around 5 lakh hectares of land are used annually for potato cultivation, yielding between 0.7 crore to 1.09 crore tons. Potatoes are crucial to the nation's agricultural economy. However, potato production is threatened by various diseases like early blight, late blight, brown spot, bacterial wilt, and septoria blight, which have led to decreased yields and export levels. Early blight shows as small black lesions, while late blight appears as blistered, scalded spots, and septoria blight manifests as grey spots with dark margins. These diseases significantly impact both the quality and quantity of potatoes.
To address this issue, the proposed solution involves using deep learning models for the classification of potato leaves into healthy and diseased categories. By training on a dataset of images labeled as healthy, early blight, and late blight, the model can detect diseases early and help farmers take timely action to manage crop health. This model will utilize approximately 70% of the images for training and 30% for testing. By automating disease identification, the model will support improved potato production and exports, ultimately benefiting farmers and the country's agricultural economy.
