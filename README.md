his study explores using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect and classify potato leaf diseases, specifically early blight and late blight, in Bangladesh. The goal is to develop an automated, accurate system for disease diagnosis, which can be more efficient than traditional visual inspection.

Key Points:
Potato Diseases: Early and late blight, caused by Alternaria solani and Phytophthora infestans, respectively, lead to significant crop losses. Early detection is crucial for preventing spread and minimizing yield losses.

Image Processing for Detection: Automated image analysis using machine learning provides an efficient way to diagnose diseases in potato plants, especially in remote areas lacking expert personnel.

Dataset & Preprocessing: The study used over 2,000 images from the PlantVillage dataset, which were preprocessed through resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model performance.

CNN Model: The CNN architecture includes convolutional layers for feature extraction, MaxPooling for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification. The model achieved 98% accuracy after 40 training epochs.

Results & Evaluation: The model was trained on 80% of the data and validated on 20%, achieving strong performance with a validation accuracy of 98%. It outperformed other machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees and SVMs.

Conclusion:
The study demonstrates that CNNs can effectively detect potato leaf diseases, offering a promising tool for farmers to improve crop management and reduce losses. Future work will focus on refining the model and expanding its capability to detect more types of plant diseases.
